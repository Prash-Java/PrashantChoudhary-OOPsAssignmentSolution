# PrashantChoudhary-OOPsAssignmentSolution
Here two approaches are followed,
In first approach we have driver and service package and their respective classes based on problem statement, here modal package and classes are not used
In second approach we have driver, service, modal package and their name is appended by version and their respective classes based on problem statement, here modal package and 
respective classes are also included along with service and driver packages and classes,
Important point that was noted here is that this problem statement asks us to formulate static data and their display, and apply oops based on logic we use,
Thank You
